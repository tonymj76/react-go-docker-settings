endpoint: http://localhost:4477/server/dev

# The endpoint represents the HTTP endpoint for your Prisma API.
# It encodes several pieces of information:
# * Prisma server (`localhost:4466` in this example)
# * Service name (`myservice` in this example)
# * Stage (`dev` in this example)
# NOTE: When service name and stage are set to `default`, they
# can be omitted.
# Meaning http://myserver.com/default/default can be written
# as http://myserver.com.

# The secret is used to create JSON web tokens (JWTs). These
# tokens need to be attached in the `Authorization` header
# of HTTP requests made against the Prisma endpoint.
# WARNING: If the secret is not provided, the Prisma API can
# be accessed without authentication!
